# README

Update May 5, 2020:
I've decided for documentation to move away from org-mode to markdown so that I'm not reliant on emacs.

## Why use Emacs

I use emacs for org-mode to manage tickets and documentation.

## Downloading Emacs

[Download emacs](https://emacsformacosx.com/)

## Where is the Emacs config file located on my system

Emacs config file path `~/.emacs.d/init.el`
